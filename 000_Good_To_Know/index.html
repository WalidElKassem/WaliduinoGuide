<h3>📘 Good to know before starting</h3>

<p>Before you start building exciting projects with the Waliduino, it’s helpful to understand a few basic terms. Don’t worry — they’re simple, and you’ll master them as you go!</p>

<ul>
<li>Setup and loop</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Input and output</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>HIGH and LOW</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Analog and digital</li>
</ul>


<h3>🔁 Understanding setup() and loop()</h3>

<p>Every Arduino program is called a sketch, and each sketch must have two main parts: setup() and loop().</p>
<p>setup() runs once when your board is turned on or reset. This is where you prepare things, like setting up pin modes or starting sensors.</p>


<p>loop() runs again and again, as long as the board is on. This is where you put the code that controls what your project does continuously—like blinking a light, checking a sensor, or turning on a motor.</p>


<p>Think of it like this:</p>
<p>setup() = get ready</p>


<p>loop() = keep going</p>


<p>Both parts are required in every Arduino sketch—even if one of them is empty. They are the backbone of how your Waliduino communicates with the world.</p>

<h3>🔌 Understanding the Terms: Input and Output</h3>
<p>In electronics, we often talk about inputs and outputs. These are the two main ways your Arduino (and your Waliduino) communicates with the world.</p>

<p>🟢 What is an Output?</p>
<p>An output is a pin that sends signals from the Arduino to something else—like an LED, a buzzer, or a motor.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Turning on an LED = sending power out through a pin</p>


<p>Playing a sound = sending a signal to the speaker</p>

<p>🔵 What is an Input?</p>
<p>An input is a pin that receives signals—usually from a sensor, button, or switch.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Reading a pushbutton = checking if it’s pressed</p>


<p>Reading a light sensor = checking how bright it is</p>


<h3>⚡ HIGH and LOW — What Do They Mean?</h3>
<p>HIGH = 5 volts</p>
<p> → The pin is ON (sends power if it’s an output, or receives power if it’s an input)</p>


<p>LOW = 0 volts</p>
<p> → The pin is OFF (no power)</p>


<p>Whether you're using a pin as input or output, Arduino uses HIGH and LOW to represent voltage levels.</p>
<p>🧠 Tip: You can think of HIGH as "yes, active, on" and LOW as "no, inactive, off."</p>

<h3>🎛️ Understanding Digital and Analog I/O</h3>
<p>In electronics, we often talk about Digital I/O and Analog I/O — but what do these terms really mean?</p>
<p>Digital I/O means the pin can only have two values:</p>
<p> 0 (OFF or 0 volts) and 1 (ON or 5 volts).</p>
<p> 👉 Example: Turning an LED ON or OFF — it's either glowing or it isn’t.</p>


<p>Analog I/O, on the other hand, can work with a range of values between 0 and 5 volts.</p>
<p> 👉 Example: Reading a temperature sensor that changes smoothly — like 22.3°C, 24.8°C, etc.</p>


<p>You can think of it like a light switch vs. a dimmer:</p>
<p>Digital = just ON or OFF</p>


<p>Analog = smoothly adjusting the level, like brightness or volume</p>


<p>The Waliduino lets you use both types — so you can build smart systems that react to buttons and measure real-world values like light or heat!</p>
