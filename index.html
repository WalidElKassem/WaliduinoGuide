<h3>**🔌 External Connectors – Expand Your Projects\!**</h3>

<p>The <strong>Waliduino</strong> board comes with a set of <strong>external connectors</strong> that give you even more flexibility. These connectors provide access to some of the <strong>digital and analog pins</strong> of the Arduino Nano, so you can attach your own <strong>sensors</strong>, <strong>LEDs</strong>, <strong>motors</strong>, or other components.</p>

<p>These extra pins are perfect if you want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Connect additional modules like a **temperature sensor**, **joystick**, or **buzzer**</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Build custom circuits or extend the board's functionality</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Try out new ideas and experiments beyond the built-in components</li>
</ul>

<p>Each connector is clearly labeled, making it easy to know which pin you are using. Some provide <strong>digital pins</strong> (on/off signals), while others offer <strong>analog pins</strong> (for sensors that give variable readings, like light or temperature).</p>

<p>🛠️ <strong>Tip:</strong> Always double-check the voltage and pin type before connecting external components. Most sensors work with <strong>5V</strong> and <strong>GND</strong>, which are also available on the connectors.</p>

<p>With these external ports, the Waliduino grows with your imagination. Start simple, then explore more as you learn\!</p>
